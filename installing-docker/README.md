# Installing Docker

Docker makes it possible to run an application in different computer environments \(Windows, Mac OS, Linux\) using containers. The containers include all of the applications's needs \(libraries and dependencies\) in addition to the actual code for the program. But before you can use Docker images, you must install the Docker engine. Installation details vary somewhat depending on your operating system. Here we provide guidance for installing Docker under Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.
