# Installing Docker for Mac OS

Before installing Docker Desktop in your Mac computer, you must make sure that your system meets the minimum requirements outlined below. These requirements depend on the CPU installed in your computer. Refer to the Docker installation instructions at https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/ if the instructions below still leave you wondering.

## Mac with Intel processor requirements:

* **OS Version:** Your MacOS version must be 10.14 or newer (that is, Mojave, Catalina, or MacOS Big Sur). Upgrading to the latest version of MacOS is recommended. If you experience any issues after upgrading your MacOS to version 10.15, you must install the latest version of Docker Desktop to be compatible with this version of MacOS.
* **RAM:** At least 4 GB of RAM.

**NOTE:** VirtualBox prior to version 4.3.30 must not be installed as it is not compatible with Docker Desktop.

## Mac with M1(Apple silicon chip) processor requirements:
* Rosetta 2 must be installed as a prerequisite. To install Rosetta 2 manually from the command line, run the following command from the terminal:

```
software update --install-rosetta
```

**NOTE:** Please refer to https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/apple-silicon/ for any  "known issues."
