To use RDPTools, with the Docker engine running, open a terminal and enter:  

```
docker start rdp_tools
docker attach rdp_tools
```

You should then see a prompt similar to``` RDPuser@216930f78851:~$``` in the terminal and may begin using RDP_Tools. See https://john-quensen.com/workshops/workshop-2/ for tutorials on its use.
